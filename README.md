# Show Bars

Show Bars is a Foundry VTT module that allows GMs to quickly show/hide the following items on a folder of tokens:
 - PC names
 - PC Health Bars
 - NPC Health Bars

 ## To install
 In the add-on modules interface, click *Install Module*.  Paste the following URL into the field that reads *Manifest URL*: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zarmstrong/fvtt-showbars/main/module.json

 Or you can search for **Show Bars** in the *Filter Packages* field.

 ## To use
 In the actors tab, right click on any folder.  Select a menu option and it will apply the settings to every item in that folder. It does NOT go into nested folders, you have to apply to each level of folders individually. 

 # Additional notes

 This module has been tested with Pathfinder 2e only. It might work for others, but only Pathfinder 2e is officially supported.  That said, any system that uses *attributes.hp* to track HP should work.

 Want me to support another system?  Post an issue requesting it!
